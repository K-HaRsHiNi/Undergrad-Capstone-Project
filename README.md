Multifunctional smart wheelchair, using voice, joystick and touch control with real-time patient condition monitoring

*******************************ABSTRACT********************************
A handicapped person with physical disabilities needs a wheelchair to perform
functions that require him/her to move around. The person can do so manually by
pushing the wheelchair with hands. However, it is not easy for the disabled and elderly
people to maneuver a mechanical wheelchair. Hence it is desirable to provide them with
a motorized wheelchair that can be controlled through voice commands, joystick or a
mobile phone with real-time obstacle avoidance capability. Such features with ease of
operability is offered at an affordable cost to individuals and independent philanthropist
organizations. Such a wheelchair proves to offer a ‘leg-up’ to the members of the
differently-abled community. In this context, an attempt has been made to propose a
wheelchair, which uses the captured signals from the user’s choice of action and
processes it to control the wheelchair. The signals which are captured and translated are
converted into movements by the microcontroller which in turn moves the wheelchair.
The physical parameters of the patient are monitored. An alert signal along with the
parameters and location of the patient is sent in cases of emergency to the concerned
guardian and medical consultant through text message using Internet of Things (IoT).
Advancements to the wheelchair are done by means of rollover detection during slope
climbing.
The wheelchair can be operated in four ways like forward, reverse, left and right
with voice commands. But in case of noisy environments or people with the inability of
speech, voice commands cannot be provided. For such cases, joystick is used to operate
the wheel chair. The wheelchair can also be operated with the help of android mobile
touch commands. Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the obstacle. LCD is used to
display the status of the operation. Also, heart rate sensor monitors the heart rate of the
patient continuously and sends an alert to the guardian and/or the concerned medical
consultant by SMS. Accelerometer sensor reads the spatial coordinates of the vehicle
and indicates immediately for any slight deviations from normal.
